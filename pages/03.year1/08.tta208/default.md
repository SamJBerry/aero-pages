# Manufacturing Methods
* __Closed die forging__ - A softened material is forced into shape as the die surrounds it and applies a force deforming the material into shape. It creates a strong and relatively reproducible result by tooling is very expensive
* __Open forging__ - Very manual method of forming shapes with heated materials. Very expensive given the manual labour and not very repeatable.
* __Casting__ - A molten liquid is poured into a die. Multiple types of dies can be used depending on the desired quality and cost. Sand casting is very good for one time or small batches as the sand die is destroyed with each item produced. Die casting can result in a more repeatable result but has a much higher initial tooling cost. Pressure casting can also be used for complex shapes to ensure the molten material fills the die completely.
* __Sheet metal forming__ - Very cheap, quick and reliable method since it is very repeatable and stock is cheap. Obviously limited in the type of part producible.
* __Laser cutting__ - Relatively cheap and produces very accurate pieces. The process is limited by the heat produced with the laser which can result in unwanted warping and crack propagation due to the temperature delta in the material.
* __Water jet cutting__ - More expensive than laser cutting and is often less accurate but you don't have problems with heating like you do with laser cutting
* __Injection moulding__ - Very cheap after expensive tooling. Can produce thousands of products very quickly. Plastic parts produce relatively strong components for their weight.
* __Investment casting__ - A form of casting using a sacrificial wax mould. Creates a component that requires minimal work once casting is complete.
