# Crystal Structure and Crystal Packing
## Crystal Structures

Crystals in a material are built up with crystal lattice. Crystal structures can be defined as a unit cell, which is the smallest group of atoms that has the same crystal structure.

### FCC - Face-centred cubic lattice

The FCC lattice is a cubic unit cell with one atom on each corner and one atom on each face.
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(8\times\frac{1}{8}) + (6\times\frac{1}{2}) = 4$

### BCC - Body-centred cubic lattice

The BCC lattice is a cubic unit cell with one atom in each corner of the lattice cube and one in the centre
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(8\times\frac{1}{8}) + 1 = 2$

### HCD - Hexagonal close-packed lattice

The HCD unit cell is a hexagonal shape with an atom on each corner, on the top and bottom faces and 3 atoms in a triangular arrangement completely inside of the unit cell.
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(12\times\frac{1}{6}) + (2\times\frac{1}{2}) + 3 = 6$

## Crystal Packing

The packing efficiency is defined as: $\frac{Volume of atoms inside of unit cell}{Volume of unit cell}
