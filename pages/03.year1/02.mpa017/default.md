# Crystal Structure and Crystal Packing
## Crystal Structures

Crystals in a material are built up with crystal lattice. Crystal structures can be defined as a unit cell, which is the smallest group of atoms that has the same crystal structure.

### FCC - Face-centred cubic lattice

The FCC lattice is a cubic unit cell with one atom on each corner and one atom on each face.
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(8\times\frac{1}{8}) + (6\times\frac{1}{2}) = 4$

### BCC - Body-centred cubic lattice

The BCC lattice is a cubic unit cell with one atom in each corner of the lattice cube and one in the centre
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(8\times\frac{1}{8}) + 1 = 2$

### HCD - Hexagonal close-packed lattice

The HCD unit cell is a hexagonal shape with an atom on each corner, on the top and bottom faces and 3 atoms in a triangular arrangement completely inside of the unit cell.
Number of atoms in unit cell: $(12\times\frac{1}{6}) + (2\times\frac{1}{2}) + 3 = 6$

## Crystal Packing

The packing efficiency is defined as: $\frac{Volume of atoms inside of unit cell}{Volume of unit cell}

### Examples

1. Calculate the packing efficiency for a FCC lattice.

$$
\text{Shortest path across touching atoms is 4r across face of unit cell.}\\
l^{2} + l^{2} = (4r)^{2}\\
2l^{2} = 16r^{2}\\
l = \sqrt{8r^{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}r\\
\text{Volume of cell} = l^{3} = 16\sqrt{2}r^{3}\\
\text{Volume of atoms in cell} = 4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pir^{3}\\

\text{Packing ratio} = \text{\frac{Volume of atoms in cell}{Volume of cell}}\\
=\frac{\frac{16\pir^{3}}{3}}{16\sqrt{2}r^{3}}\\
\approx0.74\\
